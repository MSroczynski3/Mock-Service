# Mock Service

A Spring Boot application for creating and managing HTTP mocks using WireMock and MongoDB.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Java 24** - Latest Java features and performance improvements
- **Spring Boot 3.5.4** - Modern Spring framework with enhanced capabilities
- **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)** - Type-safe build automation
- **WireMock 3.13.1** - Powerful HTTP service virtualization
- **MongoDB** - Flexible document storage for mock configurations
- **Spring Boot Actuator** - Production-ready monitoring and health checks
- **Lombok** - Reduced boilerplate code
- **Testcontainers** - Integration testing with real services

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Java 24** or higher
- **Docker Desktop** - Required for running tests (uses Testcontainers for MongoDB)
- **MongoDB** (optional for basic testing - can be configured later)
- **Git** for version control

### Docker Setup
The project uses Testcontainers for integration testing, which requires Docker to be running:

1. **Install Docker Desktop** for your operating system
2. **Start Docker Desktop** and ensure it's running
3. **Verify Docker is running**: `docker info` should not show connection errors

⚠️ **Important**: Tests will fail if Docker is not running, as they use MongoDB containers for testing.

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Mock-Service
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### 4. Verify It's Working
Open another terminal and run:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"UP"}
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./gradlew build` | Build the project and run tests |
| `./gradlew bootRun` | Start the application with hot reload |
| `./gradlew test` | Run all tests |
| `./gradlew clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `./gradlew clean build` | Clean and build from scratch |

## 🔗 API Endpoints

### Health & Monitoring
- **Health Check**: `GET /actuator/health`
- **Application Info**: `GET /actuator/info`
- **Metrics**: `GET /actuator/metrics`

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application uses `application.properties` for configuration. Key settings:

- **Server Port**: `8080` (default)
- **MongoDB**: Auto-configuration (when available)
- **Actuator**: Health endpoints enabled

## 🧪 Testing

### Prerequisites for Testing
⚠️ **Docker must be running** before executing tests, as they use Testcontainers to spin up MongoDB containers.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running first
docker info

# Run all tests
./gradlew test
```

### Test Structure
The project includes:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with Testcontainers
- MongoDB integration testing using Docker containers

### Troubleshooting Tests
If tests fail with Docker-related errors:
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
2. Verify Docker connectivity: `docker info`
3. On Windows: Check that Docker Desktop is using the correct engine (WSL2 or Hyper-V)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with Java version error:**
- Ensure Java 24 is installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly

**Tests fail with Docker/Testcontainers errors:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- Run `docker info` to verify Docker connectivity
- On Windows: Make sure Docker Desktop is using the correct engine

**WireMock HttpServerFactory errors:**
- This project uses `wiremock-standalone` for better Java 21+ compatibility
- If you see "Jetty 11 is not present" errors, ensure you're using the standalone version
- The standalone version includes all necessary HTTP server dependencies

**Application won't start - MongoDB connection error:**
- MongoDB connection is optional for basic functionality
- Configure `spring.data.mongodb.uri` in application.properties if needed

**Port 8080 already in use:**
- Change the port in application.properties: `server.port=8081`

*Happy Mocking! 🎭*
